# FinalProjectShringar

Shringar-The Jewellery Shop is a new way of buying and selling jewellery on online platform. Our goal is to save
time for the consumers where we have tried to include a feature for consumers to try out jewellery virtually. This
allows the consumers to see a virtual image of themselves in the desired jewellery of their preference. The algorithm
is designed in a way which will be compatible on any computational efficient system having a camera.
